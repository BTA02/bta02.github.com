<p>Quidstats is a fully featured stats taking web-app centered around quidditch (yes, the game from Harry Potter. It was adapted to non-flying brooms in 2005). I started developing a now defunct mobile app for stats in 2011, but have since moved it online. I started building this app in 2015, and continue to iterate and improve it. The code is hosted on github under the 'Quid-Stats-Website' repo. </p>

<p>This is the Quidstats mobile app mentioned above. It started in 2011, and was developed actively for a couple of years. Due to device limitations (who even has an Android tablet?), I decided to put it on the web. The website took what I learned from here, and applied it to a much more accesible platform</p>
