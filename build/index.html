	<p>Hi, my name is Andrew Axtell. I'm a software developer based in Chicago, Illinois. I have worked as both a web developer and an Android developer. Currently unemployed, but I'm ready to get back in to the workforce after a few weeks off. Oustide of development, I like to be outside. I like to ski, hike, and play pretty much any sport. I played lacrosse and quidditch in college, and a little bit of rugby post-college. I'm currently a free agent, so if you have a lacrosse team that needs a midfielder, I'm your guy. </p>

		<h3>Quidstats Android App</h3>
		<p>No longer under active development</p>
		<h4>Technologies: Java, Android, Android SDK</h4>
		<p>This is the Quidstats mobile app mentioned above. I started building it in 2011, and was developed actively for a couple of years. 
		I built it as a learning project. It was my first foray in to Android, and building it was one of the primary ways I learned how to 
		develop Android apps. Due to device limitations (who even has an Android tablet?), I decided to stop development on the app and put 
		a similar app on the web. The website took what I learned from here, and applied it to a much more accesible platform. This app, along 
		with my Senior Design app, is the reason I got in to Android development professionally.</p>

		<h3>Quidstats</h3>
		<p>Currently under active development</p>
		<h4>Technologies: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Angular, Ruby</h4>
		<p>Quidstats is a fully featured stats taking web-app centered around quidditch (yes, the game from Harry Potter. It was adapted to 
		non-flying brooms in 2005). I started developing a now defunct mobile app for stats in 2011, but have since moved it online. I started 
		building this app in 2015, and continue to iterate and improve it. This was my first real web development project. I think it's a pretty 
		ambitious to start my web development career with, but I liked the idea so much I pushed through the difficult learning process. 
		This site wouldn't exist without the help of David Brownman, who helped me get it going. I knew a bit of HTML and CSS at the start 
		of this project. I had to brush up on that, as well as all the other techs that make this app run.</p>

		<h3>LessonBuilder</h3>
		<p>Currently under active development, but I have left the company</p>
		<h4>Technologies: HTML, CSS, Coffeescript, React.js</h4>
		<p>This is a web app I built at my last job. I'm including it here because I was the lead on the project while I was there. I was 
		responsible for creating the app, iterating on it, adding features, and gathering and responding to feedback. This is a free tool 
		for teachers we built as part of a research group at the University of Michigan. I had an amazing time working with the handful of 
		developers there. Obviously, this app was a team effort. We had an existing backend that this app needed to integrate with. We also 
		had other apps that needed to interoperate with this one. As a team, we were able to accomplish those goals and get this app (and others) 
		in to the hands of teachers. It's a free app, if you want to check it out and play with it. All it takes is a Google Drive account.</p>

		<h3>The Collabrify Suite of Apps</h3>
		<p>No longer under active development</p>
		<h4>Technologies: Java, Android, Android SDK</h4>
		<p>The Collabrify Suite of Apps are a suite of Android apps that I helped build and maintain when I first started working as an Android developer. They haven't been in development, as they have been moved online. These apps, like LessonBuilder, were built for a previous job. I did not build all these apps from scratch. As with most work done for a company (or research group), they were a group effort. I had to learn the existing code, add features, and maintain the apps. I also built an underlying framework to bring the code duplication between the apps to a minimum.</p>
